## Objects

In this activity, we'll explore some additional concepts that you'll encounter in more depth later on in the course.

Open the Chrome devtools Console, type in `console.log` and then hit enter

What output do you get?// ƒ log() { [native code] }

Now enter just `console` in the Console, what output do you get back?
// console {debug: ƒ, error: ƒ, info: ƒ, log: ƒ, warn: ƒ, …}
Try also entering `typeof console`
// 'object'
Answer the following questions:

What does `console` store?
//stores an object that contains lots of built-in debugging functions
What does the syntax `console.log` or `console.assert` mean? In particular, what does the `.` mean?
//means “get the log (or assert) property from the console object”
